# Automate-the-boring-stuff-with-Python-solutions
I am currently going through a book by Al Sweigart named Automate the boring stuff with Python. 
This is just to compile the solutions to different tasks posed in the book. I am completely new 
to Python as well as GitHub. So please forgive unintended errors.
